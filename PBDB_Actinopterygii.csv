In 2001, one of the authors (M.E.S.) collected a partial skull, mandibular fragments, and twelve anterior cervical vertebrae that were exposed in the intertidal zone. The anterior portion was already lost due to erosion. This material was later described by Suíçrez and Fritis (2002) and referred to the genus Aristonectes. Species-level identification was precluded at that time due to the lack of preparation. A second excavation was independently executed at the same site in early 2009 and was carried out by a team of the\r\nUniversidad de Concepcií_n (Chile) and the Institut fur Geowissenschaften, Universití_t Heidelberg (Germany). This excavation recovered 119 blocks of sandstone, most of them with bony material, some damaged due the degradation of the bones by periodic seawater immersion that turned the more delicate portions into brittle surfaces. Also, several contacts were lost as sandstone blocks were cut out of the beach with a rock saw at low tide. The precise location of both excavations (skull in 2001 and postcranial skeleton in 2009) was identified during 2009 by two of the authors (R.A.O., D.R.R.), confirming that they were recovered from the same stratigraphic layer and separated by a distance of only 1.5 m. The taphonomic distribution of bones was consistent in the two excavations, indicating a north-south directed dispersal pattern of the skeleton (Fig. 2), with the skull and anterior vertebrae directed to the south and the trunk to the north. Bones recovered in each excavation are anatomically complementary, also indicating that they result from a single skeleton, and despite intensive searches on site no other vertebrate remains were observed, further suggesting that both excavations produced material from a single individual. Finally, measurements of the cervical centra (including correlated VLI indexes sensu Brown, 1981; O'Keefe and Hiller, 2006), and taphonomic features such as a similar pattern of distortion with cervical vertebrae crushed to the right side, are also consistent with a single individual",,,,actively mobile,,,,,,hydroxyapatite,,,,vertebrate,"R.

In 2001, one of the authors (M.E.S.) collected a partial skull, mandibular fragments, and twelve anterior cervical vertebrae that were exposed in the intertidal zone. The anterior portion was already lost due to erosion. This material was later described by Suíçrez and Fritis (2002) and referred to the genus Aristonectes. Species-level identification was precluded at that time due to the lack of preparation. A second excavation was independently executed at the same site in early 2009 and was carried out by a team of the\r\nUniversidad de Concepcií_n (Chile) and the Institut fur Geowissenschaften, Universití_t Heidelberg (Germany). This excavation recovered 119 blocks of sandstone, most of them with bony material, some damaged due the degradation of the bones by periodic seawater immersion that turned the more delicate portions into brittle surfaces. Also, several contacts were lost as sandstone blocks were cut out of the beach with a rock saw at low tide. The precise location of both excavations (skull in 2001 and postcranial skeleton in 2009) was identified during 2009 by two of the authors (R.A.O., D.R.R.), confirming that they were recovered from the same stratigraphic layer and separated by a distance of only 1.5 m. The taphonomic distribution of bones was consistent in the two excavations, indicating a north-south directed dispersal pattern of the skeleton (Fig. 2), with the skull and anterior vertebrae directed to the south and the trunk to the north. Bones recovered in each excavation are anatomically complementary, also indicating that they result from a single skeleton, and despite intensive searches on site no other vertebrate remains were observed, further suggesting that both excavations produced material from a single individual. Finally, measurements of the cervical centra (including correlated VLI indexes sensu Brown, 1981; O'Keefe and Hiller, 2006), and taphonomic features such as a similar pattern of distortion with cervical vertebrae crushed to the right side, are also consistent with a single individual",,marine,,actively mobile,aquatic,,carnivore,viviparous,,hydroxyapatite,,,,vertebrate,"R.

In 2001, one of the authors (M.E.S.) collected a partial skull, mandibular fragments, and twelve anterior cervical vertebrae that were exposed in the intertidal zone. The anterior portion was already lost due to erosion. This material was later described by Suíçrez and Fritis (2002) and referred to the genus Aristonectes. Species-level identification was precluded at that time due to the lack of preparation. A second excavation was independently executed at the same site in early 2009 and was carried out by a team of the\r\nUniversidad de Concepcií_n (Chile) and the Institut fur Geowissenschaften, Universití_t Heidelberg (Germany). This excavation recovered 119 blocks of sandstone, most of them with bony material, some damaged due the degradation of the bones by periodic seawater immersion that turned the more delicate portions into brittle surfaces. Also, several contacts were lost as sandstone blocks were cut out of the beach with a rock saw at low tide. The precise location of both excavations (skull in 2001 and postcranial skeleton in 2009) was identified during 2009 by two of the authors (R.A.O., D.R.R.), confirming that they were recovered from the same stratigraphic layer and separated by a distance of only 1.5 m. The taphonomic distribution of bones was consistent in the two excavations, indicating a north-south directed dispersal pattern of the skeleton (Fig. 2), with the skull and anterior vertebrae directed to the south and the trunk to the north. Bones recovered in each excavation are anatomically complementary, also indicating that they result from a single skeleton, and despite intensive searches on site no other vertebrate remains were observed, further suggesting that both excavations produced material from a single individual.

Nevertheless, a small number of invertebrates and plants have been recovered. They are generally very small and poorly preserved. There are gastropods (internal casts that seem identical to those found at Vila Vila21 and Tiupampa28), and Bryozoa. The flora is composed of charophytes. Some fish taxa (Gasteroclupea, Atherinomorpha), already reported at Pajcha Pata ( [Gayet, 1991] and [Gayet et al., 1991]) do not come from the main level but are from the area that includes this locality discussed in this paper.
